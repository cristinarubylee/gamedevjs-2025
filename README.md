## Description

Knott M. Hunter is definitely *not* a monster hunter who traps biblical entities in enchanted books. He is, however, desperately in need of an accountant.

Lucky for him, you stumble upon his job posting for someone to help "balance the books."

Unlucky for him, you take that a bit too literally...

Now you're hard at work, pulling books from his shelves and neatly stacking them on his table. But be careful‚Äîthese aren't ordinary books. Some have been used to seal away angels, demons, and other dangerous entities.

**Let three of the same kind get too close together, and they'll gather enough power to break free!**
